# Kaggle Datathon: [DataHub 2.0]

## Problem Statement
Music is as much a powerful form of human expression as it is an entertainment. Over time, it has developed from the earliest calls and rhythms, into a huge variety of different genres. The high contrast between the simplicity of folk songs to the complexities of classical symphonies and the hypnotic rhythms of dance music suggests that we can effectively assign a category to each song based on various elements. For example, genres can be defined by the use of specific instruments. If the piece was being played in a certain style using orchestral instruments, then we could classify it as classical music. Similarly, if the instruments were highly distorted guitars, we would classify them as rock or heavy metal. Likewise, drum and bass use a very fast bpm and is primarily electronic.

Currently, many music aggregator applications rely on machine learning to power their recommendation engine, and curate playlists. 
> In this challenge, you are expected to develop a machine learning model with the given dataset which classifies music into genres, taking into account relevant features.

## Objective
Your goal is to predict the correct genre of each music record, given their respective features!

## Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this competition is Categorization Accuracy - the percentage of predictions that are correct.

## Program Description
The program involves preprocessing of data using pandas and building a predictive categorical model.

As accuracy is the key, 3 models have been built; Two models using Sci-kitLearn, GaussianNB and DecisionTreeClassifier, and the last one using Tensorflow Keras Deep Learning model. The model which gives the highest accuracy will be opted.
Replace `PATH_TO_TRAIN_CSV` and `PATH_TO_TEST_CSV` with the path of your train.csv and test.csv files.

Feel free to play with the Deep Learning Model by tweeking hyperparameters, number of layers, Optimization and Loss functions, etc.

**Important:** Beware to not overfit your model, else it won't perform well on the test dataset.
The final prediction on the Test data is stored in  `submission.csv`
**NOTE:** As training Neural Networks is hardware intensive, its better to run the model using Google Colab.
